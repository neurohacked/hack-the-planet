# Hack the Planet

### Description:
Hack the Planet is a simple javascript game that employs the use of jquery.

### Logic:
The player starts with a choice between 4 hackers. Once the player has picked their hacker, the code prevents hacking until a defender is chosen from the available rivals. The player hacks their opponent starting at a base hacking power, depending on the hacker chosen, which is then multiplied by 2 after each hack and defender counter hacks with a static counter hacking power. The player's goal is to defeat all rivals without loosing all of their hacker's data connection.

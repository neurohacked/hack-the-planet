# Hack the Planet
Hack your rival hackers to prove you are the best hacker!

## Game Logic

Hack the Planet uses constructors to create the available characters and prototypes for functions that are used to interact between each character. When your character attacks a rival, they will counterattack. Your hacking power becomes progressively better with each hack so you must strategically choose your rival targets to come out on top.
